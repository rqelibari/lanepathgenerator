# Lanepath Generator
Lanepath Generator is a python 3 script, which generates lane paths on a SVG street map.
The street map must be a SVG file with `<path>`-elements. The script will write a new SVG file with new `<path>`-elements, which represent the different lanes on the streetmap.

# How to use
Clone the repository, open a Termial and `cd` into the new directory. Then run:

    # pip install .
    # lanepathegenerator ./input.svg ./output.svg

More information is following during the development.
